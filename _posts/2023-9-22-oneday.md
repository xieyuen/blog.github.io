歌词:

```
Sometimes I lay
Under the moon
And I thank God I'm breathing
Then I pray
Don't take me soon
'Cause I an here for a reason

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativtiy surrounds
I know someday it'll all turn around because
All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for, for the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
There'll be no more wars
And our children will play
one day * 3
one day * 3

It's not about win or lose
We all lose
When they feed on the souls of the inncent
Blood drenched pavement
Keep on moving though the water stay raging
In this maze you can lose your way (your way)
It might drive you crazy but don't let it faze you no way (no way)

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativtiy surrounds
I know someday it'll all turn around because
All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for, for the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
There'll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day * 3
One day * 3

One day this all will change
Treat people the same
Stop with the violence
down with the hate
One day we'll all be free
And proud to be
Under the same sun
Singing songs of freedom like 
Stop

One day * 2
One day * 2

All my life I've been waiting for
I've been praying for 
For the people to say
That we don't wanna fight no more
There'll be no more wars
And our children will play
One day * 3
One day * 3
