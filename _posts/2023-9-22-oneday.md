One
One Day, One Day, One Day
One Day, One Day, One Day
Sometimes I lay under the moon
And I thank God I'm breathing
Then I pray don't take me soon
'Cause I an here for a reson

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it grt me down
So when negativtiy surrounds
I know someday it'll all turn around because
All my life I been waiting for
I been praying for, for the people to say
That we don't want to fight no more
They'll be no more wars
And our children will play
one day (one day)
one day (one day)
one day (one day)

Sometimes I lay under the moon
And I thank God I'm breathing
Then I pray don't take me soon
'Cause I an here for a reson

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it grt me down
So when negativtiy surrounds
I know someday it'll all turn around because
All my life I been waiting for
I been praying for, for the people to say
That we don't want to fight no more
They'll be no more wars
And our children will play
one day (one day) * 3
one day (one day)
one day (one day) * 3
one day (one day)

This all will change
Treat people the same
Stop with the violence down with the hate
One day we'll all be free and proud to be
Under the same sun
Singing songs of freedom like 
Stop

one day (one day) * 3
one day (one day)
one day (one day) * 3
one day (one day)
Tomorrow (The Day will come) * 3
Tomorrow (The Day will come)
Tomorrow (The Day will come) * 3
Tomorrow (The Day will come)

All my life I been waiting for (Tomorrow)
I been praying for (The day will come)
for the people to say
That we don't want to fight no more (Tomorrow)
They'll be no more wars
And our children will play
one day (one day) * 3
one day (one day)
one day (one day) * 3
one day (one day)

one day (one day)
one day (one day)
one day (one day)
